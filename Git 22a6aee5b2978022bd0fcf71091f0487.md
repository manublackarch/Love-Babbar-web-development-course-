# Git
## Git vs Github
- **Github**
    - its a cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories
    - with this we can collaborate with others, manage projects, and even contribute to open source projects
    - it lets us upload our git tracked code online
    
- **Git**
    - a version control system that helps track changes in code overtime
    - with it we can go back to any previous version of our project
    - it’s a tool that works locally

## Git setup
- download and install git bash from there official website [Git - Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  and make a github account
- open git bash and configure your identity
- by this cmmnd we can setup name that will show up in our commits : `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- this cmmnd links our commits to our github account : `git config --global user.email "your@email.com"`
- to check our git settings like our entered username and email : `git config --list`
- use of `--global` means its applied to all our git projects, we just need to set it once

## in the end:
- so in short to make and connect a github repository to git
- simply make a repository of name of your project at github, go in the project repo and copy the project repo link
- come to your local computer and clone the github repo : `git clone [https://github.com/manublackarch/Love-Babbar-web-development-course-.git](https://github.com/manublackarch/Love-Babbar-web-development-course-.git)`
- now create any directory or file which you want to upload to your code repo
- create a code file : `touch test.py`
- now to add this file to staging area : `git add .`  dot (.) basically adds all the files and dir and for single file we can add name of dir or file: `git add filename`
- now commit file to git dir and add a message : `git commit -m “message like filename updated”`
- now upload this file to github repository online : `git push`
